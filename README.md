# Ray-Tracer

The majority of this code comes from an online textbook:
[_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

Much of the code is provided by the textbook to help the reader understand how a ray-tracer functions. The textbook is fantastic, and I would highly reccomend it!

I have built upon the foundation of the code to implement new shape surfaces and surface materials.
